# Requirements

We prioritize according to the MoSCoW method.

## Must have

* Fundamental working 2D fluid simulation that is visible.

## Should have

* Enact force on the fluid with the mouse.
* Boundaries along the window border.
* GUI for altering fluid properties, e.g. viscosity, density, velocity diffusion and perhaps vorticity.

## Could have

* Addable objects as boundaries in the scene for the fluid to interact with.
* A scene that is partially filled with fluid.

## Will not have

* 3D simulation
