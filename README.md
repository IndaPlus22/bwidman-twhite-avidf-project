# bwidman-twhite-avidf-project
A real-time interactable fluid simulator for Newtonian, incompressible fluids. You can add density and movement with the mouse as well as change fluid properties via a GUI.

Written in Rust and render as well as handle input via the [Piston game engine](https://www.piston.rs/).

The simulation implementation follows a [paper written by Jos Stam](https://damassets.autodesk.net/content/dam/autodesk/research/publications-assets/pdf/realtime-fluid-dynamics-for.pdf).
